I've been toying with Arduinos lately. This is a simple traffic light. It's not super useful for practical applications as it's currently just a single set of lights. But our toddler is having a blast stopping his little Matchbox cars on red.

I do have some nRF24L01+ transceivers laying around. So one idea would be to incorporate them to make the whole thing more useful.
